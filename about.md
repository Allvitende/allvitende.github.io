Hey, I'm Brodie.

I am a self taught software engineer and this is my website. Currently, I'm a Research Software Engineering Intern at <a href="https://www.ameslab.gov/">Ames National Laboratory</a> working on computational chemistry and machine learning as part of the <a href="https://science.energy.gov/wdts/suli/">SULI program</a> sponsored by the <a href="https://energy.gov/">Department of Energy</a>.

Have a look at some of my blog posts to get an idea of what I'm up to.

Thanks for reading!

-Brodie
