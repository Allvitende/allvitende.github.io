title: Final Thoughts on my Internship at Ames National Lab
---
As my internship at Ames National Lab draws to a close, I have had the opportunity to reflect on some of the lessons I have learned here. I have expanded my knowledge of Python and programming as a whole much more than I thought I would initially before coming here. I also now have gained first-hand knowledge on how a research institution operates at scale. This is been very valuable for my future career aspirations.

I was able to complete my project to the satisfaction of my research team. Just this past Monday I prepared a lengthy presentation of the work I did and how I achieved the results that I did. This skill in presenting has been one that I have tried to work on in the past but is hard to practice! I am extremely grateful for having the opportunity to grow as a software engineer at Ames National Laboratory. I will take the information and experience I have gained with me in my next career step after graduation.
