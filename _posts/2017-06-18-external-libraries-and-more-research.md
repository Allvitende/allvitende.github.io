title: External Libraries and More Research
---

After a solid week of coding last week at my internship, I have realized that I need to do some additional research on what problem I am actually trying to solve and the tools I will need to solve it. One of my goals this summer was to further my expertise in Python and programming in general. Python can be a deceiving programming language. On the surface it seems simple to put together new scripts (which it can be) but to truly master all that it has to offer you must absorb yourself in documentation.

Another great thing about the Python language is the fact that there are so many additional packages/modules you can use. This is extremely convenient and helps in avoiding the all to common "reinventing the wheel" issue in programming. This week at my internship I dedicated to mastering some of the more esoteric Python functions and packages. While in the short term it may have seemed unproductive, it will pay great dividends as I get deeper in my project.
