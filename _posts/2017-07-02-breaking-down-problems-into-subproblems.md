title: Breaking Down Problems into Subproblems
---
One of the more important lessons I have learned this week at my internship is the importance of breaking down big problems into a lot of subproblems. This is one of the fundamental ideas of all types of engineering, but it never really hit home until I started to work on a large scale software project at my internship this summer.

It may seem obvious at first, but the concept of breaking down big problems into subproblems is an skill that cannot be taught. The end goal of the project when you look at it may seem hard to get to, but once you start breaking it down it becomes a lot more manageable to do. This is partly because it is difficult for our brains to hold the solutions to so many problems all at once.

One of the key ideas of software engineering is to build lots of small "black boxes" that solve small portions of the overall problem but can be developed independently of each other. You then use these boxes as building blocks to solve the bigger problem that is usually the desired goal of the project. This is one of the most important things I have learned so far at Ames National Lab.
