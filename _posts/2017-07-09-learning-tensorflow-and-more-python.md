title: Learning TensorFlow and More Python
---
This week at my internship, I took a break from coding and mostly focused on learning the machine learning tool called TensorFlow. TensorFlow, which is developed by Google, is an open source toolkit for machine learning (which is what I am working on this summer at Ames National Lab). TensorFlow makes it easier to setup machine learning models and formulas or models without having to code all the math from scratch.

In addition to learning more about TensorFlow, I have also been doing some research on machine learning algorithms and implementations in Python. TensorFlow has Python bindings which will be helpful to understand well to implement the machine learning model for my project. I also went through some of the content in Stanford professor Andrew Ng's machine learning course on Coursera to gain more background knowledge.
