title: Important External Libraries for the Project
---
One of the most important aspects of software engineering is the tools that we use. In reality when working towards a solution to an engineering problem, there is almost always someone who has had the same problem as you. This is where the open source software community really helps solve interesting problems. This summer has been no exception to this rule at my internship.

I have come to realize that, picking the right tool is equally as important as completing the project itself. If you complete the project but it doesn't work correctly because of the chosen tools you use then it could have catastrophic consequences. Two tools that I have made heavy use of this summer have been Scikit and NumPy. Both saved me about a week of time not having to write code to solve these problems myself and using these external packages has been crucial to the success of my project.
